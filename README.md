Introduction
      In the competitive banking industry, understanding customer behavior is essential for driving business growth and profitability. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to help banks identify 
customers who are likely to make transactions in the future. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and customer data, the model provides insights into customer behavior patterns and predicts transaction 
propensity with high accuracy.

Features

- Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Model Development: Implement machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., to build predictive models.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models using techniques such as grid search cross-validation to optimize performance.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Identify key features that influence transaction propensity and gain insights into customer behavior patterns.
- Model Deployment: Deploy the final model into production environment for real-time transaction prediction and integration with banking systems.
